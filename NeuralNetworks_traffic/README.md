My experimentation process. 

What did I try? 

I tried using different numbers as droput out rate.

I tried removing the hidden layer.

I tried a different number as output unit.



When I remove the hidden layer, I noticed my accuracy rate seemed to be higher.

When I set the drop out rate to be higher,  I noticed my accuracy rate seemed to be lower.
